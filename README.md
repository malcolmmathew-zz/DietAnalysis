##Food Data Analysis

This project is an investigation into creating a diet harnessing the power of data science. I wanted to investigate this to see if I could take the stress out of deliberating over what to eat on a daily basis and write a program that would construct a healthy diet for me. 

The program feeds in data from various web resources to create a dataset of ingredients with attached nutritional information and sorts it into food groups. 

The program then receives user inputs on food group preferences to create a list of suggested combinations of ingredients.
